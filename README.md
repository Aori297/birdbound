# BirdBound

You’re a bird (yes, that thing in the game is a bird). You flap. You go up. You pass through pipes to score points. If you hit a pipe? Well, you’ll see the game over screen faster than you can say “Oops.” It’s a simple game.

## Features

- **Flap Like There’s No Tomorrow**: Press `Space` to give your bird a boost.
- **Random Pipe Gaps**: Because why not make things a little unfair?
- **Score Counter**: Count how many pipes you managed to pass. Bragging rights are optional.
- **Game Over Screen**: A lovely little screen that shows up when you (inevitably) crash.

## Future Plans (Maybe)

If this bird ever makes it out alive, here are some cool features that might be added:
- **Sound Effects**: Every flap, crash, and maybe a cheerful score chime.
- **Background Music**: Something catchy to vibe with while flapping.
- **High Score Tracking**: So you can see how much you improved (or didn’t).

Inspired by *that* flapping game everyone couldn’t stop playing and rage-quitting.
Enjoy!
